# SMS Spam Detection – NLP Machine Learning Project

## 📌 Overview
This project is an NLP-based machine learning model that detects whether an SMS message is spam or not. It uses the SMS Spam Collection Dataset and applies text preprocessing techniques to train a Logistic Regression classifier.

## 🚀 Features
- Uses real-world dataset (5,500+ SMS messages)
- Text preprocessing with TF-IDF Vectorization
- Logistic Regression ML model
- Achieves 96–98% accuracy
- Command-line interface to test messages

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- TF-IDF Vectorizer
- Logistic Regression
- VS Code

## 📂 How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
2. Place `spam.csv` in the project folder.
3. Run:

## 📈 Results
- High accuracy (97%+)
- Correctly detects spam keywords
- Handles noisy and mixed-case text
